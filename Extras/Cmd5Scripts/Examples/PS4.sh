# This Cmd5 example demonstrates a script that is compatible with
# cmdSwitch2's example of controlling a PS4.
#
# Your Cmd5 .homebridge/.config.json file would have a state_cmd like:
# state_cmd: ".homebridge/Cmd5Scripts/Examples/PS4.sh"
#
# Testing from the shell prompt:
#    ./PS4.sh Get PS4 On
#    or
#    ./PS4.sh Set PS4 On 1
#    or
#    ./PS4.sh Set PS4 On 0

# Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status
set -e

# Check if the first parameter to this script was "Get" for getting an accessory's
# specific attribute.
if [ "$1" = "Get" ]; then

   # Normally we would exit immediately if a command fails with a non-zero status.
   # In this case ps4-waker can fail and we would rely on the failing exit status to
   # tell Cmd5 that the accessory is not on the network. That would be the prefered
   # thing to do. However for this example we are going to output '0' (false) so
   # that you can see the '0' on the console telling us that the accessory is not
   # on the network.
