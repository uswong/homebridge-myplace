#
# Description:
#   This script is a goood starting place for you to create Cmd5 Scripts
#   of your own
#
# Parameters are:
#    Get < Any accessory name > < Characteristic>
#    Set < Any accessory name > < Characteristic> < value >
#
# Note 1: These paramaters match the those of the Cmd5 plugin.
#         A full lost of supported devices and characteristics can be
#         found at:
#         https://ztalbot2000.github.io/homebridge-cmd5
#
# How it works:
#
#    The Cmd5 plugin will call this script to retrieve those states
#    you have defined as not Cached to Get/Set your devices characteristic
#    states.
#
#    For example:
#       bash ExampleScript_template.sh Set My_Door TargetDoorState 0
#     or
#       bash ExampleScript.sh Get My_Door CurrentDoorState
#

set -e

# Exit immediately for unbound variables.
set -u
