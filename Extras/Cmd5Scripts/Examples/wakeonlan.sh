# This Cmd5 example demonstrates a script that can be used for a wakeonlan
# scenario. It is a port of the cmdSwitch2 example and is more for a Windows
# PC.
#
# Your Cmd5 .homebridge/.config.json file would have a state_cmd like:
# state_cmd: ".homebridge/Cmd5Scripts/Examples/wakeonlan.sh"
# state_cmd_suffix: "192.168.2.66 dc:a6:32:40:de:7c"
#
#
# Testing from the shell prompt:
#    ./wakeonlan.sh Get HTPC On 192.168.2.66 dc:a6:32:40:de:7c
#    or
#    ./wakeonlan.sh Set HTPC On 1 192.168.2.66 dc:a6:32:40:de:7c
#    or
#    ./wakeonlan.sh Set HTPC On 0 192.168.2.66 dc:a6:32:40:de:7c

# Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status
set -e

# Check if the first parameter to this script was "Get" for getting an accessory's
# specific attribute.

   # parameter to a Get command.

   # parameter to a Get command.
   macAddress="${5}"

   # Normally we would exit immediately if a command fails with a non-zero status.
   # In this case ping can fail and we would rely on the failing exit status to
   # tell Cmd5 that the accessory is not on the network. That would be the prefered
   # thing to do. However for this example we are going to output '0' (false) so
   # that you can see the '0' on the console telling us that the accessory is not
   # on the network.
   set +e

   # On OSX the string is returned differently than on linux.

   # on the network by seeing if the return code of the above command passed or
   # failed.
