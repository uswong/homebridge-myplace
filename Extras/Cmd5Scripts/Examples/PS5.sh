# This Cmd5 script uses playactor to turn on/off a PS5.
#
# You will need to install playactor and have the command in a global PATH
# or modify this script with its actual PATH.
#
# Your Cmd5 .homebridge/.config.json file would have a state_cmd like:
# state_cmd: ".homebridge/Cmd5Scripts/Examples/PS5.sh"
#
# Testing from the shell prompt:
#    ./PS5.sh Get PS5 On
#    or
#    ./PS5.sh Set PS5 On 1
#    or
#    ./PS5.sh Set PS5 On 0
